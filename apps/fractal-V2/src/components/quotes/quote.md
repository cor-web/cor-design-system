Block Quotes
The blockquote element represents a section that is being quoted from another source. Good blockquotes should include a citation, but one is not required. Stylistically, these can look a lot like pull-quotes by using :before and :after pseudo elements for the curly quotes, or, authors can include them inline.

The contents of blockquote are limited to headings and paragraphs. header, footer, or cite tags are not allowed. For more examples, see A List Apart's sample blockquote patterns.
