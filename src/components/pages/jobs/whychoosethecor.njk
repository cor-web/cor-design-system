        <ul class="list-none">
          <li>
            <h3>Interesting and challenging work</h3>
            <p>At the CoR, you work for a small institution but you can work on the major issues that you read about in the news every day: global pandemics, climate, cohesion, digital and demographic transitions, as well as the flow of migration, to name but a few.  Our job in the General secretariat is to support our Members by delivering on a wide range of issues and tasks, from diverse policy work to organizing meetings, from human resources and finance to IT, translation and communications. We are a consultative body, with about 540 staff members, with flat reporting structures and many opportunities to liaise with other departments and work on shared projects.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>International working environment </h3>
            <p>You will meet colleagues from all EU Member States on a daily basis. The multinational, multilingual working environment is very enriching and stimulating. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>#ShapingEuropeTogether - A job that really matters </h3>
            <p>Working at the CoR , you work to improve the lives of approximately 450 million European citizens. This is a challenge and a privilege, every day.</p>          
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Job mobility </h3>
            <p>We do not offer 'a job for life' but a 'lifetime of different jobs'. Through our Talent Management Strategy, we give you the opportunity to learn and grow. You build your own career path and we help you through challenging assignments, coaching, mentoring, in-house and external development opportunities (in-house or inter-institutional job shadowing) and job mobility.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we offer you a wide range of learning opportunities. We encourage your personal development and enable you to improve and update your technical and professional expertise.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Health and safety</h3>
            <p>Your health and safety is our priority. We keep you informed about health and safety at work by organising a series of conferences and participatory events throughout the year.  </p>
