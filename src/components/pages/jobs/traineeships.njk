        <p>As a CoR trainee, you will be witnessing first-hand the dynamics of a multilingual and multinational institution. Within a small group of trainees, you will not only be able to work across a wide range of EU policy aspects, but you will also have the unique possibility to create an event by yourself! Thanks to the unique YFactor scheme, trainees are invited to carry out project works addressing issues that are relevant for European regions and cities. Whether you decide to work on a conference, a podcast, or an eBook – as a CoR trainee your creativity will be challenged and encouraged!</p>
