          <ul class>
            <li>General administrative support to President, Bureau, and members as required, in particular regarding matters under the responsibility of Directorate A (registry, members' services, protocol); authorisation requests for members' individual presences</li>
            <li>Administrative support to the Group's Secretary General and Deputy Secretary General</li>
            <li>Budget administration and monitoring (including checking compliance with regulations)</li>
            <li>Coordinating the first drafts of the annual management plan, risk assessment, activity report</li>
            <li>Group branding (production and design of publications, corporate materials, business cards, etc.)</li>
            <li>Administration and logistics of Group and Bureau meetings (interpretation, room bookings, speakers and participant reimbursements, booking catering)</li>
            <li>Communications with members about logistics and administration, handling their registrations, logistics & administrative queries</li>

            <li>Liaison with the CoR administrative services regarding relevant procedures, rules and regulations</li>
            <li>Ensuring good functioning of the office, including monitoring and ordering office supplies, and facilitating installation into office for new colleagues and trainees</li>
            <li>Monitoring of the Renew Europe email account</li>
            <li>Maintaining the team Outlook calendar up to date with key dates</li>

            <li>the ability to work pro-actively, anticipating deadlines and driven to deliver quality results</li>
            <li>a strong "customer service" culture, aiming to ensure the Renew Europe members receive a service of the highest standards</li>
            <li>excellent analytical, planning, and drafting skills</li></li>
            <li>the ability to quickly acquire new skills and knowledge</li>
