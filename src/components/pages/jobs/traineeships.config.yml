  description: "In a standard traineeship, you will be witnessing first-hand the dynamics of a multilingual and multinational work environment. Within a small group of trainees you will not only be able to attend a wide range of conferences, forums and seminars, but you will also have the unique possibility to create an event by yourself! "
